                    Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. I have always
                    been a computer guy I remember inspecting elements in middle
                    school and changing some text and thinking I hacked the
                    school website. To then creating my own website with basic
                    HTML and CSS in high school. From there I decided to go to
                    college for Computer Science where I studied languages like
                    C++ and learned how to think like a programmer.{" "}
                    <a href="#pablo">links</a> for people to be able to follow
                    them outside the site. The ability to create things you
                    think of into a real space fascinates me. I love solving
                    problems and being creative so programming is perfect for me
                    it seems as it has always been a part of my life. Currently,
                    I am learning more frameworks next I plan to learn back-end
                    and in a few years delv into machine learning.
                  </p>
